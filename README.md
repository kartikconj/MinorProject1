# MinorProject1
Android Project for University of Petroleum &amp; Energy Studies
The aim of this project was to resolve an issue in UPES of finding free slots between faculty-faculty, faculty-students and find 
free room in entire university at a given slot
The project contains two views- Faculty and Admin
The admin view has all the CRUD privleges for the application, whereas a faculty can only view their time table, find free slots and 
free rooms.
